Po Flet Valbona (“Valbona Speaks Out”) is an informational campaign presenting the complex issues surrounding hydropower development in Valbona Valley National Park.  By presenting information in a question-and-answer format, Po Flet Valbona creates an atmosphere of discussion, moving from simple concepts to more complex questions.  The Po Flet Valbona materials have been produced by <a href="http://toka-albania.org/">TOKA</a> (The Organization to Conserve the Albanian Alps) as part of a project “Per Valbonen, Per Shqiperine” funded by Leviz Albania.
